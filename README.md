# AI-ResizeToArtBounds

What It Does
===

This is a script for Adobe Illustrator to resizes the artboard of the open document to the size of the art bounds. There is also a version that prompts for a folder, and resizes the artboards for all Illustrator *.ai files in that folder.

Note: Files with multiple artboards will have the first artboard resized to encompass the art bounds from all artboards.

Why Do It?
===

The purpose of the script is to fix the common problem affecting many Adobe Illustrator files where the artboard is much larger than the art. This causes the preview to be tiny in applications and operating systems that base their prevew on the artboard size.
